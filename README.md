A challenge is to make a webpage responsive. The webpage first changes the colour concerning viewport width and also re-arranges the paragraphs it contains as follows;

* for a screen smaller than 480px, the three sections are stacked on top of one and other.
* for screen bigger than or equal to 480px and smaller than 1024px, the first paragraph takes 2/3 of width, the second 1/3 of width and the third the full width.
* for screen bigger than or equal to 1024px, the three divs should be next to one another.
